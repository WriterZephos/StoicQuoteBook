# Stoic Quote Book

## Introduction
Stoic Quote Book is a handly little app that will let you save awesome quotes you come across while reading your favorite books on stoicism or other philosophical disciplines. There are many features planned to help you live the good life.

### Planned Features
* User accounts.
* Single sign on with google, etc.
* Private collections of quotes.
* Ability to use the app offline, even add quotes etc, which will be synced when you are back online.
* Automated periodic email/text to remind you of your favorite quotes.
* Ability to share quotes on social media.
* API for other systems to access the quote database.
* Duplicate checking to prevent duplicates from being entered.
* Much, much more!

## Technical Description
Stoic Quote Book is a mobile first, progressive web app built with React and Ruby on Rails. It uses service workers to cache pages to enable the app to work with no internet connection if you install it on your device.

While the app will load pages offline, it still doesn't load data offline. It is a work in progress and I hope to get it completed and ready for beta testing by the end of the year.
